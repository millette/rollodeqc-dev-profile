I know this is hosted on GitHub pages, so this is a bit tricky. Here is an idea I had. It's a bit hacky, I must admit, and totally incomplete.\r\n\r\n- Have an RSS feed of the incidents\r\n- Have a MailChimp account, or something similar, and integrate it with statuspage\r\n- Have _something_ that sends email for new RSS entries\r\n\r\nI looked at the MailChimp \"RSS to email\" feature, but it's not fast enough, it would be a day late, that's useless. It doesn't look like it's possible with IFTTT or Zapier, but I might have missed something.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to host a service doing that, but I would prefer not to have to host an app to do that, but have something easy.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is nothing that fits the vision you have, but I thought I would share my thoughts and maybe someone can complete those and we can come up with a decent solution :)\r\n\r\nCheers"

    "body": "Hey,\r\nlove what you did! I'm not using it yet but plan on doing it very soon. One thing that is missing IMHO is the ability to subscribe via email to the status updates. I know this is hosted on GitHub pages, so this is a bit tricky. Here is an idea I had. It's a bit hacky, I must admit, and totally incomplete.\r\n\r\n- Have an RSS feed of the incidents\r\n- Have a MailChimp account, or something similar, and integrate it with statuspage\r\n- Have _something_ that sends email for new RSS entries\r\n\r\nI looked at the MailChimp \"RSS to email\" feature, but it's not fast enough, it would be a day late, that's useless. It doesn't look like it's possible with IFTTT or Zapier, but I might have missed something.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to host a service doing that, but I would prefer not to have to host an app to do that, but have something easy.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is nothing that fits the vision you have, but I thought I would share my thoughts and maybe someone can complete those and we can come up with a decent solution :)\r\n\r\nCheers"
